# Learning interpretable protein dynamics using Geometric Deep Learning 

[Project Webpage](https://cch1999.github.io/dynamics_report/index.html#summary) | [Paper Version](https://github.com/cch1999/protein-stability/blob/master/figs/poster.pdf)

MSc Project 2 for Bioinformatics degree at Imperial College London looking into learning interpretable protein dynamics using Geometric Deep Learning.

## Getting Started

## Inspiration

With work is large inspired by two papers and I give much credit to the authors:

1. Greener, Joe G., and David T. Jones. "Differentiable molecular simulation can learn all the parameters in a coarse-grained force field for proteins." bioRxiv (2021). - [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/02/07/2021.02.05.429941.full.pdf)

    This work showed that
